# Project-6--Classification-With-Multi-Class-Data

Description
- The Classification model is a supervise learning. this model used for prediction for classification value.
- In this case, the model is designed to predict the CATEGORY_ERROR with mutiple label. 

Objective
- The dataset have multi-class issues,use label encoding to the category value.
- Set Features and Target Features
- Choose features CATEGORY_ERROR because this label have multiple lable and well suited to do classification.
- Model Classification will be Logistic Regression,Random Forest, and SVC (RBF).
- Build a model Classificatioon to Predict category of the CATEGORY_ERROR that will be happen
- Train and Test
- Evaluate The Model
- Balance the dataset with SMOTE
- Train and Test with SMOTE
- Evaluate The Model with SMOTE
- Compare evaluation each model
- Plot Confusion Metrix
- Plot ROC curve and Precision-recall curve
- Plot Learning curve
- Plot Feature Important
- Plot SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
- For Learning Purposes
